        <h1>Calvin Lim</h1>
        <p>I am a freshman at Santa Clara University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Studio Art. My tech stack currently includes Python, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where I have worked with Selenium, SQL, and mySQL as well. I am also passionate when it comes to more artistic elements, where my work usually makes use of Adobe Photoshop, After Effects, XD, and Figma as well as illustration, sketching, and fashion design. I have developed my experience in graphic, motion, and UX design into a small freelance studio with a growing connection to clientele and professional contacts. As a freelance designer I primarily developed branding and promotional graphics for clients while also building my self-designed clothing brand alongside my freelance studio. You can take a deeper look at my fashion design on my <a href="https://www.behance.net/calvinwlim">Behance</a> and a wider view of my overall portfolio on my <a href="https://dribbble.com/calvinwlim">Dribbble</a>. You can find more about my experiences and skills on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/calvinwlim/">Linkedin</a>.</p>
